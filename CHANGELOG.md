Changelog
=========

The changelog is in reverse chronological order.

### 0.9.2

- Make ValueX-decoding resistant to null values (now actually resolves https://github.com/apple/FHIRModels/issues/39, thanks for the report [Harsh Surati](https://github.com/lets-swapcode))
- Implement a decoding depth counter through `FHIRDecodingDepthTracker` and provide a default implementation that throws when exceeding 64 levels. This is an arbitrary limit but is conceivably high enough to accommodate any FHIR payload. It can only be enforced if the user uses our provided `JSONDecoder.fhirModelsReadyDecoder`, see [how to instantiate FHIR resources](./HowTo/Instantiation.md). Because we use `OSAllocatedUnfairLock` this bumps the required OS versions for this repository
- Other improvements, such as better reporting of the coding path when no ValueX is provided but one is required

### 0.9.1

- Fix broken DSTU2 models (all `BackboneElement` types were reduced to typealiases), thanks to [Lukas Kollmer](https://github.com/lukaskollmer) for flagging
- Memory improvements (by targeted `indirect enum` / `indirect case` use), thanks again to [Lukas Kollmer](https://github.com/lukaskollmer) for your investigations & suggestions

## 0.9.0

- BREAKING CHANGES, The `Sendable` Release: makes all types adopt Swift Sendable, which means:
    - All types are now structs, all abstract types protocols. Resources and elements used to be `open class` and are now `public struct`
    - The initializers and Codable interfaces didn't change, depending on how "FHIRModels" is used in your projects there may be zero to lots of adjustments necessary
    - The top level `FHIRType` protocol is now `Sendable`
    - Abstract types, including but not exclusively `Resource` and `DomainResource`, can no longer be instantiated (and probably never needed to be), and `FHIRAbstractResource` has been removed
    - Specialized elements such as `Age`, `Count`, `Distance`, and `Duration` are mere typealiases of `Quantity`
    - Since the FHIR data models define recursive structures (e.g. "Patient" -> "Identifier" -> "Reference" -> "Identifier" -> ...), all-struct doesn't work in Swift. To work around this cyle, `Identifier` and `Reference` are now `final class, Sendable`
    - The second infinite loop is around `ResourceProxy` and `Bundle`. To break this cycle, `ResourceProxy.bundle` is now a `indirect case`
    - This finally addresses https://github.com/apple/FHIRModels/issues/26
    - Bump Swift tools version to 6.2
- Update _build_ models to 6.0.0-ballot4 (http://build.fhir.org/)

## 0.8.0

- Update _build_ models to 6.0.0-ballot3 (http://build.fhir.org/)
- Address https://github.com/apple/FHIRModels/issues/38 (thanks to [Lukas Kollmer](https://github.com/lukaskollmer) for the idea)
- Move some unit tests to Swift Testing; since with testing https://github.com/apple/FHIRModels/issues/39 cannot be reproduced, resolves #39

## 0.7.0

- Make most primitive types (such as `FHIRBool` and `FHIRDateComponents`) `Sendable`
- Address https://github.com/apple/FHIRModels/issues/36 (thanks to [Lukas Kollmer](https://github.com/lukaskollmer) for the report)
- Fix time zone description that's off for dates in timezone with DST (again, thanks to [Lukas Kollmer](https://github.com/lukaskollmer) for the detailed report!). Fixes https://github.com/apple/FHIRModels/issues/35
- Bump Swift tools version to 5.7 

### 0.6.1

- Make `FHIRPrimitve` explicitly `Equatable` (it already was via `Hashable`) and add negation overloads (fixes https://github.com/apple/FHIRModels/issues/30)
- Make the build work on Windows (thanks to @fritzt0, fixes https://github.com/apple/FHIRModels/issues/33)

## 0.6.0

- Update _build_ models to 6.0.0-ballot2 (http://build.fhir.org/)

## 0.4.0

- Update _build_ models to 4.6.0-048af26
- Enhancement: make dates & times conform to `Comparable` and `ExpressibleAsNSDate`
- Fix an issue where times with milliseconds were not proper ISO formatted in certain locales

### 0.3.2

- Fix time formatting in certain locales: https://github.com/apple/FHIRModels/issues/7

### 0.3.1
